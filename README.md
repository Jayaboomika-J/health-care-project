# Lovable Project — Sample Source

**Note:** I couldn't fetch the original project page at `https://lovable.dev/projects/b292afc8-21c2-4384-b31a-692a91e1d469` due to access restrictions.  
Below is a ready-to-download sample project and README that you can use as a starting point.  
If you paste the project's source or allow access, I can replace these files with the real project's code.

## What's included
- `index.html` — simple demo page
- `styles.css` — minimal styling
- `app.js` — small interactive script
- `README.md` — this file
- `LICENSE` — MIT license

## How to use
1. Unzip the archive.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. To run a local server (recommended):
   - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000` then visit `http://localhost:8000`

## Contact
If you want the actual source from the Lovable project page, paste its HTML or repo link and I'll recreate the exact files.
